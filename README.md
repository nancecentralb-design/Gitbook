### Key Features

**Collateralisation**\
The B4NK is designed to combine BNB backing with B4NK backing for optimal capital efficiency. $xBNB is over-collateralised as a result of the treasury-held B4NK.

**100% Fee Distribution**\
All protocol fees are distributed to B4NK token holders who stake or lock their tokens.

**Market-Based Stability**\
xBNB maintains its peg through natural market arbitrage opportunities.

**Flash Loan Protection**\
Two-step minting and redemption process prevents flash loan attacks.
